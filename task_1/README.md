Objective:

You are tasked with performing data analysis on a provided dataset using the Pandas library in Python. 
Your goal is to clean, manipulate, and extract specific insights from the data.

Dataset Description:

The dataset is a CSV file named sales_data.csv, containing sales records of a retail store. The dataset includes the following columns:

Date: The date of the transaction (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
Product: The name of the product sold.
Price: The price of the product (in USD).
Quantity: The number of units sold.
Payment_Type: The type of payment used (e.g., Cash, Credit Card, etc.).

Tasks:
- Data Loading and Inspection:
  - Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
  - Display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame.
  - Check for and report any missing values in the dataset.

- Data Analysis:
  - Convert the Date column to a DateTime type.
  - Calculate and display the total sales revenue (Price * Quantity) for the dataset.
  - Find the average price of products sold.
  - Determine the product with the highest sales quantity.
  - Group the data by Product and calculate the total quantity sold for each product.
  - Identify the most popular payment type.

- Deliverables:
- A Python script (main.py file) accomplishing the above tasks.

- Evaluation Criteria:
  - Correctness of the code.
  - Cleanliness of the code.
  - Efficiency and readability of the code.
  - Proper use of Pandas functions and data manipulation techniques.
  - Handling of edge cases and potential data inconsistencies.

Note: You are free to use online resources and Pandas documentation, but the work should be solely yours. Please ensure that you adhere to best coding practices and comment your code where necessary for clarity.
